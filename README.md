# Spring-Hibernate-Demo-Project

#### Repository with one of Real-Time projects from [Udemy Spring Course](https://www.udemy.com/spring-hibernate-tutorial/)
#### Build a Database Web App - Spring MVC and Hibernate Project

During this project I used knowledge about MVC, Spring and Hibernate. It was a great revision after lessons from the course that introduced Spring, Hibernate and MVC.

What I learned is presented in my [Spring Udemy Repo](https://github.com/mateuszkochanek/Spring-Udemy-Projects)
